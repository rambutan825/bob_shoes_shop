4.0.0.pre2 (438 commits)
----------------

New features (1)
----------------

* Shoes 4.0.0.pre1 was a single gem. Now we ship as as three gems [e16a0c4]:

  * shoes -- Home to the shoes executable. Declares dependencies on other
    shoes gems for ease of installation.
  * shoes-dsl -- Code for the Shoes DSL. No direct UI rendering and will be
    reused with all future backends.
  * shoes-swt -- The first Shoes backend, implemented in JRuby on the SWT
    library via the swt gem.

* Full style-setting functionality (element#style, setters, hash, app level) [56d91f8]
