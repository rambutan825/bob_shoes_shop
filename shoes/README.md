# shoes

This is the default `shoes` installation gem. It exists purely to depend on
the basic installation so folks can do a `gem install shoes` and get what they
expect.

The current contents include:

* shoes-core (the backend-agnostic, primary logic for Shoes)
* shoes-swt  (our current default backend, based on SWT)
* shoes-highlighter (code highlighting used by the manual)
